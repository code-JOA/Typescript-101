# Typescript-101

What is Typescript? 
Typescript is a superset of Javascript that adds static typing and other features to the language.

With typescript, you can catch errors at compile time instead of at runtime, making it easier to
write and maintain large-scall applications.

Type Annotations
They allow you to specifythe type of a variable, parameter or function return value.
This can help catch errors at compile-time rather than run-time and also provides more clarity to 
your code.

Interfaces
Interfaces in typescript define the shape of an object. They allow you to specify the required 
properties and their types as well as optional properties, function and more. 

TypeScript Benefits
Type Safety: It provides static type checking which helps catch errors before runtime. This can
lead to ffewer bugs, better maintainability and more confidence in your code.


Scalability: It is designed to scale large codebases. It's type system makes it easier to refactor 
code and maintain consistency across large projects. 

Better Code Quality: By catching errors earlier, TypeScript can help improve code quality. It can
also encourage better coding practices, such as writing more modular and reusable code.

Javascript interoperability: It is a superset of Javascript, hence it can easily integrate with 
existing Javascript code. This makes it a good choice for gradually adopting Typescript into
existing projects.
